# Orchestrator Workflow Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
The orchestrator workflow was broken where:
1. Main model spawns subagent using `spawn_agent` tool
2. Main model immediately tries to get results instead of waiting
3. Subagent completes successfully, but main model never receives results or continues
4. Main model hangs indefinitely

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Timing Issue**: `spawn_agent` tool returned immediately, ending the main model's turn before subagent completion
2. **Input Injection Failure**: `inject_input()` failed because no active turn existed in main conversation when subagent completed
3. **Event Flow Break**: `AgentCompleted` events updated UI but didn't properly resume main conversation
4. **Missing Orchestrator Integration**: Orchestrator runtime existed but wasn't properly integrated with conversation flow

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed `spawn_agent.rs` Tool Handler

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **Modified Background Task Completion Handling**:
   - Added proper result injection in `TaskComplete`, `Error`, and `TurnAborted` event handlers
   - Results are now injected directly into the parent conversation when subagent completes
   - Added fallback background events if injection fails

2. **Fixed Tool Return Behavior**:
   - Tool now returns immediately with confirmation that subagent is running
   - Main conversation stays alive to receive injected results when subagent completes
   - Proper result formatting with clear delimiters

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - All completion scenarios (success, error, abort) now properly inject results
   - Background events as fallback when injection fails
   - Consistent error messaging and status reporting

## Expected Workflow After Fix

1. **Main model** calls `spawn_agent()` with task specification
2. **Subagent** is spawned and begins working asynchronously
3. **Main model** receives confirmation and continues with its current turn (stays alive)
4. **Subagent** completes its task and fires `AgentCompleted` event
5. **Background task** injects subagent results into the main conversation
6. **Main model** sees the injected results and continues with the main task
7. **No hanging or deadlocks** occur

## Files Modified
- `codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/spawn_agent.rs`: Fixed injection timing and tool return behavior

## Testing
- All existing unit tests pass (26 passed, 1 ignored)
- All orchestrator tests pass (35 passed)
- Code compiles successfully without errors
- Created test plan for manual verification

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Start codex-local with spawn_agent-capable model
2. Submit prompt that triggers spawn_agent usage
3. Verify complete workflow works as expected
4. Monitor for any edge cases or race conditions

The orchestrator workflow should now work correctly with proper subagent result injection and main model continuation.
